The Carbon Management System Platform has been developed using various open-source platforms to create a comprehensive carbon management system for users. The primary development tool employed is Appsmith (version 1.7), a robust no-code platform that empowers both developers and users to create sophisticated and customized applications using pre-built components and user-friendly interfaces. This approach reduces the reliance on extensive coding, making it more accessible.

In addition to Appsmith, the application integrates various APIs and platforms. The Twilio Cloud API is utilized for sending SMS messages, and Grafana (version 10.2.2) serves as a dashboard for summarizing calculations. The chosen database for this system is PostgreSQL, selected for its advanced features, including row-level security, which allows users to implement restrictions on data access.

The primary objectives of this application are to facilitate the calculation of carbon emissions across all three scopes and enable users to input data on waste generated and energy consumption. The system also provides a summary display of previous calculations. These calculations are similar, involving the multiplication of activity data by corresponding emission factors.

Here are some snapshots of the main features provided by the application:
1. Calculating all three scopes' carbon emission values.
